- 👋 Hi, I’m @NoBlessCode
- 👀 I’m interested in financial investment, computer hardware and software, data-driven decisions, and creating businesses focused around my interests.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science and computer networking from a college while working a full-time labor job.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that welcomes newcomers and where I can learn from others.
- 📫 How to reach me: asishtamang28@gmail.com, 3_noblesse (insta)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm very lazy when alone so I need friends that will straighten me up and help me be focused on learning about finance and technology.
